# Microservices Communication

## 1. Synchronous Communication

In **Synchronous Communication**, the client sends a request and waits for a response from the service. The key point here is that the protocol used, such as **HTTP/HTTPS**, is synchronous, meaning the client can only continue executing its task when it receives a response from the server.

### Example:
- **Microservice1** (Client) sends a request to **Microservice2** (Server) and waits for the response before proceeding.

### Libraries for Synchronous Communication:
- **RestTemplate**
- **WebClient**
- **Spring Cloud Open Feign**

These libraries are commonly used for enabling synchronous communication between microservices.

## 2. Asynchronous Communication

In **Asynchronous Communication**, the client sends a request but does **not wait** for a response. It continues executing its tasks without blocking for a response from the service.

### Example:
- **Microservice1** (Client) sends a request to **Microservice2** but continues its execution without waiting for a response.

### Tools for Asynchronous Communication:
- **Message Brokers** such as:
    - **RabbitMQ**
    - **Apache Kafka**

These tools enable asynchronous communication between microservices by allowing messages to be sent without waiting for immediate responses.
